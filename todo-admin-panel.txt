To-Do:
	make card packs click-on-able
		they are the only nonfunctional cards atm
	form validation logic (error on duplicate key et-al)
		as well as all the validation on the settings page
	ability to view discord inventories?
	ability to link discord acct for admin priveledges there?
	add a form that uses no external files to enter external file locations
		this should be the only thing that shows up for the respective UI pages if they are missing
		these should be configurable in the settings page as well 
			the settings page uses external files though, so they can't only be editable there
		all other pages should show a warning banner about the missing files
